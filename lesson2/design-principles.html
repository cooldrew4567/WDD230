            <p>Facebook uses a lot of white space to make it more organized with each post. 
                I have noticed that Instagram and Twitter have so much clutter but Facebook seems to always feel more space friendly</p>

            <p>The Church Of Jesus Of Latter Day Saints website has a lot of repetition.
                 As you can see their is a lot of the same fonts and colors being used as well as the pictures seem to use the same grid layout.  </p>

            <p>Nike uses the rule of thirds by having a good centered picture and showing off their product by making it the center of attention .</p>
